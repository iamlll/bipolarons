# bipolarons
A compilation of various simulations, plotting functions, and data files I have accumulated for exploring bipolarons in strontium titanate (STO). There are three main schemes I have used:
- Gaussian
- Hybrid
- Nakano
In order of (my research) timeline and relevance; the Nakano calcs match the appropriate weak-coupling (plane wave, E ~ alpha) and strong-coupling (Gaussian, E ~ alpha^2) behaviors as the electron separation dist y -> inf.
